# custom-gitignore-hub
A collection of custom `.gitignore` files that can be used for different types of projects.  

These files help avoid committing temporary, system-generated, or unnecessary files.

## Purpose
This repository stores `.gitignore` files created for personal use and learning.  

They can be copied and used in any project if needed.

## Repository Structure
Each template lives inside its own folder, and the ignore rules are stored in
that folder’s `.gitignore` file. Examples:

- `Android-Studio/.gitignore`
- `Arduino/.gitignore`
- `WebDev/.gitignore`

This keeps every template ready to copy as-is while keeping the repo tidy.

## Usage
Choose the folder that matches your project type, then copy its `.gitignore`
into the root of your project (rename only if you need more than one template
in the same repo).  

Modify the contents based on your own requirements.

---
## Disclaimer
These `.gitignore` files are general-purpose examples for personal use.  

They may not cover all scenarios for every type of project.  

Before using, review the file and ensure that it meets your needs.  

Use based on your own preferences and setup.

*Updated whenever new custom `.gitignore` files are added.*
