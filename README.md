# custom-gitignore-hub
A collection of custom `.gitignore` files that can be used for different types of projects.  

These files help avoid committing temporary, system-generated, or unnecessary files.

## Purpose
This repository stores `.gitignore` files created for personal use and learning.  

They can be copied and used in any project if needed.

## File Naming Format
The file names follow a simple format (examples):

- `AndroidStudio.gitignore`
- `arduino.gitignore`

All files are placed directly in the main folder.

## Usage
Choose the `.gitignore` file that matches your project type.  

Before using, rename the file to `.gitignore` and place it in the root folder of your project.  

Modify the contents based on your own requirements.

---
## Disclaimer
These `.gitignore` files are general-purpose examples for personal use.  

They may not cover all scenarios for every type of project.  

Before using, review the file and ensure that it meets your needs.  

Use based on your own preferences and setup.

*Updated whenever new custom `.gitignore` files are added.*
